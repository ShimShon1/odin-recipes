        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p class="description">
            The fallen warriors staying in Valhalla, the einherjer, enjoy a feast every day. The boar Sæhrimnir is slaughtered and eaten every night. And right after, he comes back to life and so provides Odin's warriors with an infinite feast.

            The combination of apple, pork and onion goes way back in Danish food history. A recipe for Æbleflæsk (Apple pork) can be found in the first Danish cookbook printed in 1616. We don't know if the Vikings had the combination, but apples, onions and pork were definitely all at hand. And the Vikings did love their pork. Pig bones have been found in many excavations.

            Apple and pork is a traditional dish eaten at Yule in Denmark (but it actually tastes good all year round).
